sentencepiece is an unupervised text tokenizer and decoder mainly used for Neural Networ-based text generation. They said I can write whatever I want so let's stream of consciousness this mfer. It's gorgeous out right now and that's why I'm writing this from the patio - but I have no idea why I would decide to write about the weather. I guess it's just because most people talk about it so it becomes just, like, a default way of talking about things. It is really special here, though. The view is unbeatable and I think this is the kind of place that I would be cool retiring to. Maybe somewere with a little more accessibility but overall it's quiet and peaceful and the bridge is a great view. I wonder what the old version looked like - I heard it was kinda crappy and loud but who knows. It probably won't be worse than this. I can only wonder, though, if anything happens with this area. We are fairly close to the waterline and if any flooding occurs, this place is close to underwater. I think we have a good 10-15 feet and we're not in a low spot per se, but this place could get a lot less accessible and erosion could be a potential issue if things deteriorate in 20 or so years. Hopefully by the time I have to retire, this place will still be in nice condition and we can enjoy the place once again. Okay back to work.
